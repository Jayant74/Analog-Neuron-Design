## Analog Neuron Design

#  Neurons and Astrocytes

A neural network in the brain relies on neurons activating and deactivating in a network. The activation of a neuron requires the voltage inside the membrane to reach a certain threshold voltage. The deactivation refers to the membrane voltage being restricted and maintained underneath the threshold. In a neural network, _Neuron A's_ output will be connected to the input of _Neuron B_. It's implied then, _Neuron A_ can modulate the inner-membrane voltage of _Neuron B_. Therefore, if _Neuron A's_ output spignal has a square wave shape, the inner-membrane voltage of _Neuron B_ will increase as a function of the square wave. This can be seen in Figure 1.

Notice the step spikes in the voltage graph as a result of the RC circuit experiencing a square-wave current signal.
